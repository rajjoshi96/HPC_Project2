# HPC_Project2


In this project, we are trying to learn different concepts of MPI programming using data-structure algorithms in C. For this repo we need the installation of MPI library. We are trying to solve 3 different data-structure sorting problems in this project.
    1. Quick Sort
    2. Merge Sort
    3. Enum Sort
Detailed report is included in the repo as well to make thorough analysis about the working of the code.
